*Day: **2**/100*

## Mood
It's just day 2, but I already feel I am slipping! Work and life happened! To be successful, I need to take action. I need to identify the time blocks where I am mindlessly scrolling social media and replace them with meaningful learning moments. It’s also time to switch from being a consumer to becoming a producer.  

## Commitments:

❌ - Not done ✔️ - Done

|Commitment | Status |
| :--: | :--: |
| Code | ✔️ |
| Write | ✔️ |

## What went well
- **Code**: I am sticking to working on this website. I am trying to identify opportunities to refactor, simplify & automate. Coding is a mindset. Getting into the groove of coding feels good! 
- **Write**: This is the best piece of advice I have heard about content creation. Dont create! Record! Read that again! 
- **Other**: Happy Birthday Jakey! 🎂 Lucky 7 it is. 

## What did not go well
- Prioritizing! 

## Thoughts for tomorrow
- Prioritize what you *want*! Its now or never!
- Its the first weekend! Take action! Make it count.
