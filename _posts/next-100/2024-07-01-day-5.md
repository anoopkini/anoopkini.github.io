*Day: **5**/100*

## Mood
It just seems to get worse. I really need some quick wins to make myself feel better. 

## Commitments:

❌ - Not done ✔️ - Done

|Commitment | Status |
| :--: | :--: |
| Code | ❌ |
| Write | ✔️ |

## What went well
- **Code**: Blaah! 
- **Write**: Blaaah
- **Other**: Phew! Its exhausting. 

## What did not go well
- Mind is pretty crowded with thoughts. Unable to focus on what needs to be done. 

## Thoughts for tomorrow
- Once again! Actions speak louder than words! Priortize things that really matter.
