*Day: **1**/100*

## Mood
I am feeling pumped up. It is a beautiful new beginning. But I acknowledge the fact that it's easy to get sucked into it when it's all new and shiny. The name of the game is consistency. We have to wait and watch. 

## Commitments:

❌ - Not done ✔️ - Done

|Commitment | Status |
| :--: | :--: |
| Code | ✔️ |
| Write | ✔️ |

## What went well
- **Code**: Created a nice tracker view to track my progress on my website. Getting back to the basics with [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) & [Neetcode](https://neetcode.io). 
- **Write**: I did not write 1000 new words. There was a lot of tinkering around on the website: writing, editing & re-writing stuff which totalled well over a 1000 words. At this point my focus is more to get into the habit of spending that time equivalent of writing a 1000 words. So anything that contributes to well written articles is game. 
- **Other**: There were long pending honey do list items that I was able to check off. So feel happy about that. 

## What did not go well
- Nothing to report.

## Thoughts for tomorrow
- Write today, polish and post tomorrow.
