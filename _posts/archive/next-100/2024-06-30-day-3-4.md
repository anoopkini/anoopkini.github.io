*Day: **4**/100*

## Mood
Oh! Man! This sucks! My worst fear has come true. The weekend happened, and I slipped. 

For a fraction of a second, I thought I should just reset—restart my journey with the next 100 days. But then, I realized that these things would inevitably continue to happen. Life is going to throw its curve balls, and I need to learn to stand up and take a swing at it. 

In this journey, I need to remind myself to prioritize what I want. Setting goals is just the beginning; the journey is prioritizing your tasks so you can get s**t done. 

## Commitments:

❌ - Not done ✔️ - Done

## What did not go well
- It was a lazy day. So prerty much nothing went well except for hanging out with my neighbours. 

## Thoughts for tomorrow
- Actions speak louder than words!
