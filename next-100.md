**"Next-100"** is my attempt to transform my life by committing to certain productive habits for the next 100 days. This is the second chance I am giving myself to build these habits. My first attempt was a colossal failure; [you can read it here]({% post_url 2024-06-26-next-100 %}). I needed a reset to evaluate how I was operating and to devise a better plan to stick to my commitment. Just like that I lost 20 days. 

Once again, For the next 100 days, I am committing myself to
- Code every day. 
- Write 1000 words every day.
